> Returns true if the object has a empty property.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save has-empty-property
```

## Why is this needed?

In JavaScript, it's not always as straightforward as it should be to reliably check if a obj has a emtpy property. There are many non-intuitive edge cases that yield unexpected results:

```js
console.log(+[]); //=> 0
console.log(+''); //=> 0
console.log(+'   '); //=> 0
console.log(typeof NaN); //=> 'number'
```

This library offers a performant way to smooth out edge cases like these.

## Usage

```js
const hasEmptyProperty = require('has-empty-property');
```

See the [tests](./test.js) for more examples.

### true

```js
hasEmptyProperty({a: undefined});       // true
```

### False

Everything else is false, as you would expect:

```js
hasEmptyProperty({a: 'aa'});           // false
```
